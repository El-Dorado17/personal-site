//This file will contain the About Me function with info for my personal site and will be imported to AppViews

/*
I plan for the about me section to contain:
-A picture of myself
-a small snippet of my background

TODO: Input with radio button: Guess my favorite color
    If correct color, alert "Good Job!"
    Else, alert "try again"

When successful: Guess my favorite book series, video game, & band
